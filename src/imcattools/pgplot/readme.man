'plotcat' is useful for plotting positions, shapes etc
of objects in catalogues using pgplot.  It is also useful
for editing catalogues (with -S, -R, -M options).
'contour' reads a fits file and generates a contour plot.
'profile' actually involes supermongo, but use it with -n option
if you don't have this.
