The tools here are to help you register images taken with a
multi-CCD 'mosaic' camera.  

There are several approaches that I have developed, each of which
has advantages and disadvantages.

The tools are mostly scripts; tend to be changed quite often, but can be used
as a starting point to generate a customised procedure.

See <a href="fitgeom.html">notes on various fitgeometry tools</a>
 

These are mostly out-dated.
