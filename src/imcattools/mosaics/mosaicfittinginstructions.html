Instructions for using tools in imcattools/mosaics.

These are tools for registering images taken with a multi-chip mosaic
camera.

The steps are as follows:

1) organise your image files into directories so a typical image is
	myimagedir/chip3/foo23.fits
this image being chip number 3 and image name "foo23"

1a) if (as in the UH8K) some of the chips are inverted, then uninvert them
so that all chips have the same orientation.

2) create 3 ".db" files as follows:
	
chips.db - this gives the numbering of the chips as a perl format
arrays, as well as arrays ix and iy defining the layout.
For a simple 2*2 array:

		---------
		| 1 | 2 |
		---------
		| 3 | 4 |
		---------

the "chips.db" file might look like
	# database for chip names, positions and orientations
	\$nchips = 4;
	@chipname 	= ( 1,  2,  3,  4);
	@ix		= (-1,  0, -1,  0);
	@iy		= ( 0,  0, -1, -1);
	1;
which in this case sets the spatial origin at the centre of the array.
i.e. the (ix, iy) = (0, 0) has its bottom left corner at the array centre.
The "1;" on the final line is needed so we can "require" these database
file in our perl script.

nominal.db - this contains starting guess for the layout of chips
on the grid.  The model is that each chip is laid on a tile with
some margin, and that these tiles are then abutted.  For the 8K
my "nominal.db" contains
	# database for nominal chip layout
	# the actual size of the chips is
	\$xsize = 2048;
	\$ysize = 4096;
	# and our starting guess for their positions is that they
	# are regularly spaced blocks with surrounding margin
	\$xmargin = 30;
	\$ymargin = 10;
	# so the block size is
	\$Xsize = \$xsize + 2 * \$xmargin;
	\$Ysize = \$ysize + 2 * \$ymargin;
	1;
the idea is that this is sufficently accurate that we can constuct "mosaiccats"
and run "mergecats" on these to link stars together, the merged cat being fed to
"mosaicfit" (see below).

fields.db - this simply an array of names "fieldname", which might look like
	\$nfields = 3;
	@fieldname	= ("foo1", "foo2", "foo126");
	1;
it being assumed images with these names (and some extension like ".fits")
live in each of the image directories.  A similar naming scheme will be used for the
catalogues etc which get created.

3) Create catalogues of stars, stored in similar format to images, e.g.:
	mycatdir/chip3/foo23.stars

4) Run "makemosaiccats".  This uses the information in the data base files
to create a "mosaiccat" for each exposure.  The coordinates should be
good enough to link together stars which appear in different exposures.
You might at this point want to pass these through "getisolatedobjects"
which helps avoid bad pairs of stars in the merging process.

5) Run "mergemosaiccats1".  This does the first pass at merging and generates
a (possibly very large) catalogue of pairs of coordinates, expnums, chipnums for
stars in the file "mergemosaiccats1.out".  
You will need to use a large tolerance (because the positions are
only crude) and so you will probably contain some bad pairs.
You might therefore want to filter this catalogue be requiring that magnitudes
agree for instance.

6) Feed "mergemosaiccats1.out" to "mosaicfit" to generate "mosaicfit.par".  
This generates a first approximation to the parameters for the layout of the
chips and the pointings etc.

7) Run "mergemosaiccats2".  This uses the information in "mosaicfit.par" to
generate much more accurate sky coords for each object, which allows one
to remerge the mosaiccats wth a much tighter tolerance.  This generates
the file "mergemosaiccats1.out".  In addition to the nominal position "x",
this also contains a pair of coords "r" which the computed sky coords.
This allows one to filter yet again to remove any bad pairs (as outliers)
and one can then feed this in turn to "mosaicfit" to generate even better
parameters, and so on until you are happy with the residuals.

8) With a final "mosaicfit.par" file in hand you are ready to actually
map the images.  Rather than create a single big image, which would be
cumbersome, we instead make a patchwork quilt of abutting images.
This is done by calling "makemosaicstacks", which loops over x, y
indices to generate a stack of images for each patch in turn by
calling "makemosaicstack".  This maps the corner of each image we
want to create (according to "mosaicfit.par") and figures out which
images are going to contribute (thus, the size of the patches had
better not be substantially larger than the original image size), grabs
them and maps them into place with "mosaicmap".  
The final pixel scale need not be equal to the original - this can
help with badly undersampled images.
