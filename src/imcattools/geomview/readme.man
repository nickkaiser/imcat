The tools in this section can be used to display 3-D
FITS files using geomview's 3-D surface rendering.

These tools will only work if the geomview distribution
is installed along with the xforms library.  The location of
the geomview library directory must be supplied as an
argument to 'makemake' in order for these tools to be
implmented.
