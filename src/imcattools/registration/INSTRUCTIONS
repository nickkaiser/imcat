There are two ways to register cats using tools in this directory.

The old way does not cope with differences in scale, and requires
perl format file 'exp.db' to supply names etc., but does least squares
fitting.  It works as follows:
To get accurate transformation parameters for a stack of images
	1) run findpeaks to get brightish objects
	2) extract catalogues of stars
	3) run 'mergestacks1'
	4) run 'fitstack' with mergestack1.out as output to create 'fitstack.par'
	5) run 'mergestack2' to reject outliers
	6) run 'fitstack' again, but with mergestack2.out as input


The new way can cope with (small) scale differences, does not need the
database file, but at present does not fit for all transformations, rather
it registers each image relative to the first.  It works as follows
	1) make catalogues of stars as before
	2) run "getstacktrans <star_cat_files>" to generate an 'lc' format
	file containing the transformations (generated with 'registercats2').
	) run "makestack_lt"
