# master Makefile for the imcat stuff

# be sure to define the environment variables $(IMCATDIR), $(MANDIR), $(CC) and $(ARCH)
# IMCATDIR is where you install imcat
# MANDIR is where you keep man pages - should contain man1, cat1, html1, cat3
# CC should be an ansi compatible compiler (e.g. gcc) (or gcc -taso for OSF1)
# ARCH should identify the architecture (e.g. IRIX, OSF1, SunOS, etc...)

# follow instructions in src/README

# here are the choices for libraries that makemake decided on:
