'xfv' is an X-based Fits image Viewer I developed.  It reads a stream of
2D fits images and displays them on the screen as a movie.
<p>
There are two versions.  The one built by default uses the Imlib libraries.
You can obtain these from <a href="http://www.rasterman.com"> Rasterman's Zone of Cruft </a>.
