'xim' is a colour image viewer I developed.  It is not very fast (compared
to e.g. saoimage), but it does allow one to read 2- or 3-color images and
to modify the colormap dynamically.  I have found it useful in adjusting the
color mapping for making color postscript images to send to a printer.
A major limitation is that it only reads 16 bit images, and, if these
are color, then the format is as created by makecolorimage.
