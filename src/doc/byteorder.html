Byte-Order, FITS Standard and MAGIC Pixels in Imcat

<hr>
<h2>
From: A Voyage to Lilliput, by Jonathan Swift 
</h2>
<hr>

<p>
It began upon the following occasion. 
<p>
It is allowed on all hands, that the primitive way of breaking eggs 
before we eat them, was upon the larger end: but his present Majesty's grandfather,
while he was a boy, going to eat an egg, and breaking it according to 
the ancient practice, happened to cut one of his fingers.  Whereupon the Emperor his
father published an edict, commanding all his subjects, upon great penalties, 
to break the smaller end of their eggs.  
<p>
The people so highly resented this law, that our Histories tell us there have been 
six rebellions raised on that account, wherein one Emperor lost his life,
and another his crown.  These civil commotions were constantly formented by the 
monarchs of Blefuscu, and when they were quelled, the exiles
always fled for refuge to that Empire.  
<p>
It is computed, that eleven thousand persons have, at several times, suffered death, 
rather than submit to break their eggs at the smaller end.  Many
hundred large volums have been published upon this controversy: but the books of the 
Big­Endians have been long forbidden, and the whole party
rendered incapable by law of holding employments.  
<p>
During the course of these troubles, the emperors of Blefuscu did frequently 
expostulate by their ambassadors, accusing us of making a schism in
religion, by offending against a fundamental doctrine of our great prophet 
Lustrog, in the fifty­fourth chapter of the Brundecral (which is their Alcoran). 
This, however, is thought to be a mere strain upon the text: for their words are 
these; That all true believers shall break their eggs at the convenient end:
and which is the convenient end, seems, in my humble opinion, to be left to 
every man's conscience, or at least in the power of the chief magistrate to
determine.

Byte order in Imcat
</h2>
<hr>
<p>
While the original FITS standard did not specify a particular byte
order, the NASA <a href="http://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov" target="_top"> NOST FITS definition </a> has decreed
a big-endian ordering.  This is of course inefficent on little-endian
machines such as DEC Alpha and Linux on PC's, so I have decided to
ignore NASA and to store images on disk in native format. I have provided
a command <a href="man/changesex.html">changesex</a> which swaps the byte order.
<p>
I appreciate this can be confusing if you are accessing images from machines of
differing byte ordering conventions.  As of 11/8/98 I have added the ability to
define an environment variable IMCATSWAPFITSBYTES which, if defined, causes
the fitsio routines to input and output image data in non-native format (i.e.
the opposite byte ordering from that used internally).  So, for example, you might define
this on your DEC-ALPHA but not on your Sun workstation, in which case all
FITS files (and FITS data piped between processes) will conform to the
NOST decree and you can access the data using binaries on either machine without
confusion.
<p>
FITS images writen by imcat tools contain a header item with
key BYTEORDR and with value BIG_ENDIAN or LITTLE_ENDIAN to
indicate the byte order.
<p>
Note that there are command line options for 'saoimage' which allow it to read
images of either persuasion.

<h2>
Magic pixel values
</h2>
Certain 'magic' pixel values are used to flag data as corrupt.  Essentially all imcat image processing
functions test for these values and ignore them and generate magic output values as appropriate.
<p>
The magic values are defined in  fits.h (see
<a href="man/imlib.html">imlib</a> man page)
as
<pre>
------------------------------------------------------------------
BITPIX          MAGIC VALUE
------------------------------------------------------------------
8               UCHAR_MAX=255
16              SHRT_MIN=-32768
32              INT_MIN=-2147483648
-32             (-((float)  0x80000000) * ((float)  0x80000000))
-64             (-((double) 0x80000000) * ((double) 0x80000000))
------------------------------------------------------------------
</pre>
<p>
The image calculator command 
<a href="man/ic.html">ic</a>
has a flag you can use to convert
magic pixels to some other chosen value.
<p>
Some other software (e.g. IRAF) uses NaN to flag bad pixels.  This 
only works for floating point images (BITPIX = -32 or -64).  
As of 12/2/98, if you want
your float or double images to use this convention then define
the environment variable IMCATCONVERTNANS.  If this is defined then
the low level imcat functions for reading images will, for
BITPIX = -32, -64, convert any NaN's to imcat MAGIC values, and the
low level image writing routines will convert MAGIC values back to
NaN's on output.  An advantage of this approach is that saoimage,
for example, will not get confused by the bad pixels.
