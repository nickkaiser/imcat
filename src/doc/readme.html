<h2>about imcat </h2><hr>
<p>
The 'imcat' software was developed initially to do faint
galaxy photometry for weak lensing studies, and provides
a fairly complete set of tools for this kind of work.
<p>
Unlike most packages for doing data analysis, the tools here
are provided as a set of standalone unix commands which you can
invoke from the shell, via shell scripts or from perl scripts
as you think appropriate.  You don't have to learn a new
shell syntax - just use whatever you are most comfortable
with - and you can just use whatever bits you want.  The imcat libraries
are not shared, so you can just download a single executable if you like.
The standard unix and pgplot libraries are shared, and you may need
to explicitly locate them via the LD_LIBRARY_PATH env variable.
<p>
All of the commands have a "man-page".  The html versions here tend to be
out of date, but the most definitive version for any command
can always be obtained by issuing the command with the '-u' (for
usage) flag.  Of course, there is no guarantee that these
are perfectly accurate - as a last resort simply peruse the c-code
which is well known to be "self-documenting" ;)

<h2> organisation </h2>
<p>
The tools are arranges in a tree of directories.
<p>
One main branch is the 'imtools'.  These deal only with
fits files.  The most important imtool is the 'image
calculator' 'ic' which allows one to do rather general
operations on fits images.
<p> 
A second branch is the 'catools' which operate only
on catalogues.  The key cattool is 'lc'; this effectively
defines the format of imcat catalogues, and allows one to
do very general operations on and filtering of such catalogues.
<p>
A third branch is the 'imcattools'.  These tend to be much
more specialised than the cattools and imcattools and are
focussed on faint galaxy photometry.  They also tend to be more
volatile than the other sections as they are under active development.
