<h2>fitgeometry, fitgeometry2, fitgeometry3 notes</h2><hr>
<pre>
'fitgeometry' assumes a 'rigid detector model' - and is
therefore probably inadequate.

'fitgeometry2' and 'fitgeometry3' assume a 'jello detector model'.
The difference between them is that fitgeometry2 reads the
result of merging a set of N catalogues, wheras fitgeometry3
reads a concatenation of catalogs (which must contain a particle
number 'p', as well as the coordinates etc of the opbject detections).

   With 'fitgeometry2' we read in the result of merging a set of 'planes' of images,
   the first of which should be a 'reference' image (with plane number = 0).
   We then solve for a set of transformations for all the other images and
   for the positions of the N distinct objects which appear in the input
   merged catalogue.  
 
   Let there be nm modes for for each image: i.e. coordinates in the
   reference system for the p'th object in terms of its measured
   position on the i'th image (if present) is given by
                r_p = x_pi + sum_m a_im f_m(x_pi) + e_pi
   whereas for the reference image
                r_p = x_p0 + e_p0
   where the e_pi is the error in the p'th object's position on the ith frame
   with <e_pi^2> = s_pi.
 
   The chi-squared we need to minimise is
  
        chi^2 = sum_p [ sum_i E_pi (x_pi - sum_l a_il f_l(x_pi) - r_p)^2 / s_pi^2
                        + E_p0 (x_p0 - r_p)^2 / s_po]
   where E_pi = 1 if object p is found in catalgoue i.
 
   Minimisation gives
        nm * (nimages - 1) + np
   linear equations for the distortion mode amplitudes a_il and
   the np object locations.  The result is a set of transformation parameter
   files and locations for a 'reference catalogue' which can be then used
   to warp images.
 
   This gives the following set of linear equations for the a_il, r_p's:
 
        A x = B = 
        = -   -

'fitge ometry3' solves the same set of equations, but is
presented with a concatenation of previously identified
and linked ojects. This could be the cats output by fitgeomtry2,
which would allow one to do a refinement by rejecting outliers
from the first solution.
