<h2>cattools_lmodel readme file</h2><hr>
<p>
This section contains some tools for fitting data to 
models which are superposition of mode functions:
<p>
	a(x) = sum_m a_m f_m(x)
<p>
where x is some position vector (of arbitrary length),
and a is a tensor of arbitrary rank. Possible examples
are polynomials, fourier modes, Zernike polynomials etc..
<p>
These 'lmodels' are output as lc-format catalogues with
the following required header items:
<pre>
string		model_type		e.g. polynomial, zernike
string		aname			name of dependent variable
string		xname			name of independent variable
int		xdim			length of independent variable

and the following optional header items

int		nmodes
double		*xorigin

and for polynomial models
int		lmin
int		lmax

and for Zernike models
int		nmin
int		nmax

and for Fourier models
int		kmin
int		kmax
double		lbox
</pre>
<p>
Supported models are
<p>
<h3>Polynomial models</h3>
<p>
model_type = polynomial
<p>
The mode functions are labelled by a set
of indices p[] with same length as x[], the functions are
<p>
f_p = x0^p0 x1^p1 .... = product x_i^p_i
<p>
and the order l = sum p_i lies in the inclusive interval lmin-lmax.
An alternative parameterisation of the indices is in terms of
the order array l[i] = l - sum_i=0^i-1 p[i], in terms of which the
p-indices are p[i] = l[i] - l[i+1].
<p>
<h3>Zernike polynomials</h3>
<p>
model_type = zernike
<p>
The Zernike polynomial mode functions are only defined in two dimensions
and are given by the functions U_n^m as defined in eq 10 of sec 9.2.1 of Born and Wolf.
<p>
<h3>Fourier modes</h3>
<p>
model_type = fourier
<p>
The modes are indexed by the vector k[] (which has the same length as x[])
and the auxilliary index i, and the modes are
<p>
f_k^j(x) 
<p>
where
<p>
f_k^0(x) = cos(2 pi k.x / L)
<p>
and
<p>
f_k^1(x) = sin(2 pi k.x / L)
<p>
Only one half of k-space needs to be occupied.  The standard set of
modes are defined to be those for which the first non-zero
component of k[] is non-negative. 
Additionally, the mode k=0, i=1 is not used.
