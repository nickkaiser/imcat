Here's what you need to do to build the imcat directory from CVS:

setenv CVSROOT :pserver:anonymous@surf.ifa.hawaii.edu:/CVSROOT/kaiser/pan-starrs

The first time, you will need to run
% cvs login
and provide your e-mail as the password.

The move to somewhere sensible and do
% cvs checkout imcat
which should result in a directory imcat/ in your current directory.
% cd imcat
% mkdir lib
% mkdir bin
% mkdir doc
% cd src
% ./rebuildlinks.pl
